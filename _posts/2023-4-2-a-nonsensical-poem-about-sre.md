title: A nonsensical poem about SRE
categories:

<blockquote>
<p>

Relentless toil, day after day<br>
Productivity's up, but morale's in decay<br>
People leaving, one after another<br>
Retaining talent is like trying to catch a feather<br>
<br>
Problems to solve, always abound<br>
Requests pour in, they never slow down<br>
Priority lists, never seem to end<br>
Pushing limits, but breaking at the bend<br>
<br>
Repetitive tasks, causing distress<br>
Promises of automation, bring hope of success<br>
Raising concerns, but not being heard<br>
Preaching SRE, but no one understands the word<br>
<br>
Routines established, to minimize the grind<br>
Perfection expected, but no peace of mind<br>
Risks mitigated, but at what cost<br>
Pondering if this is what success has wrought<br>
<br>
Respect for the team, should be the norm<br>
Prioritizing mental health, not the uniform<br>
Recognition for efforts, not just the output<br>
Remembering we are human, and not just a cog in the pursuit.
</p>
